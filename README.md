# repoBuddy

A RebornBuddy plugin that automatically updates add-ons from configured repositories.

Commonly used repositories are already [included in `repoBuddyRepos.xml`](#included-repos). To remove undesired add-ons, edit `repoBuddyRepos.xml` or configure via Plugins > repoBuddy > Settings before enabling repoBuddy.

ℹ️ Any updates to `Default.repoBuddyRepos.xml` will require you to delete `repoBuddyRepos.xml` in order to receive added/removed repos automatically. If you don't want to lose existing settings, you can also manually add or remove the changed entries.

## Installation

1. Close RebornBuddy if it's already running.
2. Install [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999). Choose the `vcredist_x64.exe` version.
3. Download [`repoBuddy-master.zip`](https://github.com/Zimgineering/repoBuddy/archive/master.zip).
4. ⚠️**Before** extracting, unblock the `.zip` file: right click > Properties > Unblock > Apply
5. Extract RepoBuddy to `RebornBuddy\Plugins\`, **removing `-master`** so it looks like:
   ```
   RebornBuddy
   └── Plugins
       └── repoBuddy
           ├── repoBuddy.cs
           └── ...
   ```
6. Delete any existing add-on folders that are included in `Default.repoBuddyRepos.xml` to prevent errors later.
7. Launch RebornBuddy.
8. In the Plugins tab, enable "repoBuddy", then let the bot restart and auto-install add-ons.
9. Revisit Plugins > repoBuddy, then click > Settings > One-Time Downloads.
10. Install any desired one-time downloads, then click "Restart RebornBuddy" for one last auto-install.

## Proxy/VPN settings

Edit the following file in a text editor (e.g., Notepad). `%appdata%` will auto-expand to the correct folder.

Config file: `%appdata%\Subversion\servers`

Example:

```ini
[global]
http-proxy-host = 127.0.0.1
http-proxy-port = 4200
```
